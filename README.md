SCEP
====
Inspired by micromdm/scep, I want a simple SCEP service to issue
(and optionally renew) certificates for my in house devices which
doesn't rely on any other service. The service shall be secure enough
that I can expose it on Internet so I'll need a strong authenticating
method other than simple static challenge passwords.
